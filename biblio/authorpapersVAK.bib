We propose a new mathematical model of a human pose in a video sequence, which incorporates motion and pose parameters. We show that the model of (Park and Ramanan, 2011) is a particular case of our model. We introduce a framework to infer an approximation of the optimal value in the proposed model. We use an exact algorithm of motion parameters estimation to reduce complexity of inference. Our approach outperforms results of (Park and Ramanan, 2011) in the most complicated video sequences.",

Also we use the Flock of features and the normalized cross-correlation, as visual tracking algorithms, to construct tracklets. Our experiments reveal that all proposed modifications allow producing more robust trajectories than trajectories produced by basic algorithm.",
